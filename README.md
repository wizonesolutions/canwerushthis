"Can we rush this?" Checklist
=============================

This is a collaborative checklist aiming to answer one question: if we rush this code out the door, will it hit us on the way out?

Conventions
===========

The checklist uses the first person plural ("we") since it is usually within a team that this checklist would be useful. When it refers to "code," it means sub-optimal code that will potentially be produced.

Usage
=====

When you need to decide if you should do something quickly and omit the steps you'd normally take when writing maintainable code, refer to the checklist. If you can't check off all of the items, you should consider a more maintainable approach. The goal of the checklist is to save you headaches later from a rushed decision right now.

Sometimes a "hack" (see note) is genuinely the best approach. Many times, there is a better way. The checklist is here to provide guidance on whether another attempt to find a better way should be made or whether a hack really is "good enough."

If you are running a business and your developer has directed you here, they are probably trying to save you money down the line and avoid support requests stemming from error-prone software.

If you're a developer, use this checklist as leverage when trying to prevent the above.

Ultimately, you need to know your own project's goals and weigh everything against them. This is a tool.

*hack*: developer slang for making things work in any way possible, often not following the standards or patterns of the software or framework that the "hack" is being made against. It does not refer to actual computer hacking.

Contributing
============

File issues to suggest new checklist items. Note that this is not solely a developer tool, although developers and project managers are probably most fit to shape it. To that end, keep it readable to businesspeople (if you **are** a developer, this may include your clients) as well.
